Server side programming
=======================
This programming should be done to make pages dynamic
We can use following two java technologies for server side programming
1)Servlets
2)JSP

Servlets
========
This technology is one of the most popular web application develoment technology
We will build server side programs using this technology
These server side programs are known as servlets
Class of these servlet must implement javax.servlet.Servlet interface either directly or indirectly

Servlet interface
=================
It has following 5 methods
1)public void init(ServletConfig config)
2)public void service(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res)
3)public void destroy()
4)public String getServletInfo()
5)public ServletConfig getServletConfig()

javax.servlet.GenericServlet class
==================================
It is implementation of Servlet interface.It has overridden four methods of Servlet interface
service() method is not overrridden in this class
So we can define/create servlet by inheriting GenericServlet class 

javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet class
====================================
It is a child of GenericServlet class
So we can define/create servlet by inheriting HttpServlet class 
It is most widely used way to create servlet

Above classes and interfaces are defined by web server vendors not java vendors
It means jar file of these classes and interfaces must be added into project
